# Assignment {#safety-assignment status=ready}

The goal of this assignment is to ask you to think critically about how to
ensure robots are operated safely, and to devise guidelines for operating your
robot safely.

## OSHA Safety Analysis (50 points)

*Write your answers in `answers.txt`*

Read the OSHA Technical Manual on [Industrial Robots and Robot System
Safety](https://www.osha.gov/dts/osta/otm/otm_iv/otm_iv_4.html).

Perform a hazard analysis for the drone, based on the OSHA guidelines. Make
sure you answer each of the following subquestions in a few sentences.

1. What tasks will the robot be programmed to perform?
Robots are generally program to perform unsafe, hazardous, highly repetitive, and unpleasant tasks. They have many different functions such as material handling, assembly, arc welding, resistance welding, machine tool load and unload functions, painting, spraying

2. What are the startup, command, or programming procedures?
Are among the factors to be considered for proper selection of an effective robotic safeguarding system.  


3. What environmental conditions are relevant?
Electromagnetic or radio-frequency interference (transient signals) are relevant, because they exert an undesirable influence on robotic operation and increase the potential for injury to any person working in the area.

4. What are location/installation requirements to fly the drone?
Must keep aircraft in line of sight at all times. Must remain under 400 feet. Must fly only during daytime. Must fly at or below 100 mph. Must always yield right of way to manned aircraft. Must not fly over humans. Must not fly from a moving vehicle.


5. What are possible human errors?
possible human errors are Inherent prior programming, interfacing activated peripheral equipment, or connecting live input-output sensors to the microprocessor or a peripheral which can cause dangerous, unpredicted movement or action by the robot. The incorrect activation of the "teach pendant" or control panel is a frequent human error. The greatest problem, however, is over familiarity with the robot's redundant motions so that an individual places himself in a hazardous position while programming the robot or performing maintenance on it.

6. What maintenance is necessary?
the necessary maintenace are stated in the ANSI/RIA R15.06-1992 standard, Section 6.8

7. What are possible robot and system malfunctions?
The possible breakdown of the robot's drive components, tooling or end-effector, peripheral equipment, or its power source are malfunction. The release of parts, failure of gripper mechanism, or the failure of end-effector power tools (e.g., grinding wheels, buffing wheels, deburring tools, power screwdrivers, and nut runners) are a few types of mechanical failures.
Pneumatic, hydraulic, or electrical power sources that have malfunctioning control or transmission elements in the robot power system can disrupt electrical signals to the control and/or power-supply lines. Fire risks are increased by electrical overloads or by use of flammable hydraulic oil. Electrical shock and release of stored energy from accumulating devices also can be hazardous to personnel.


8. What is the normal mode of operation?
normal mode of operation function as if you were sitting in the cockpit piloting the control. The controls are relative to the front of the drone. 

## FAA Rules (20 points)
*Write the answers to these questions in the corresponding sections in `answers.txt`*

In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration regulates
outdoor flight.  (It does not regulate flight indoors.)  Read the [FAA
website](https://www.faa.gov/uas/) on Unmanned Aircraft Systems.
Provide short answers to the following questions.


1. What procedures should you follow when flying your drone outside
   the CIT?  (You might find it easiest to use the [B4UFLY Smartphone
   App](https://www.faa.gov/uas/where_to_fly/b4ufly/)).
register and carry proof of registration with you, Fly only for recreational purposes, Follow the safety guidelines of a community based organization, Keep my drone within my line of sight, or within the visual line-of-sight of a visual observer who is co-located and in direct communication with me, Never fly near other aircraft, especially near airports, Never fly over groups of people, public events, or stadiums full of people, Never fly near emergencies such as any type of accident response, law enforcement activities, firefighting, or hurricane recovery efforts, never fly under the influence of alcohol or drug


2. What is the closest airport to the CIT? Hint: Make sure to check for
   heliports as well.
one hospital trust heliport

3. What are some risks of drone flight? How could people get hurt with the
   robot?
   some of the risk are collusion with an aircraft and the drone can malfunction, fall and hurt people is the drone is flying or a crowd.

4. Do you need to register your drone?
Yes if i want to fly outdoor

5. When do you need to report an accident to the FAA?
we should report an accident to the FAA when a serious injury to any person or any loss of consciousness; or Damage to any property, other than the small unmanned aircraft

## Thanksgiving Break (10 points)

*Write your answers in `answers.txt`.*

Answer the following questions about flying at home over Thanksgiving break.

1. What are the risks?
I might hurt people around or fly in a resctricted area

2. What should you do to plan?
make sure that i have a open indoor space, that my drone is register to fly in the area i am in.

3. What safety precautions should you take before you fly?
try to fly my drone in a nest or in an enviroment where i will not hurt anyone

## CIT Lobby (10 points)

*Write your answers in `answers.txt`.*

Answer the following questions about flying in the CIT lobby.

1. What are the risks?
we run the risk of hurting people and there is no enough space to flight

2. What should you do to plan?
fly in the lab

3. What safety precautions should you take before you fly?
make sure the area is cleared and people are aware of the drone flying
